## About the Video Course
According to a recent study conducted by a major Cyber Security firm, less than half the online population understands the term "Firewalls" - or know if they have one enabled on their PC. Firewalls are even more important in a corporate or work environment. It not only keeps the corporate network safe - but can also optimize traffic routing and provide a whole range of other benefits. If you are connected to the Internet, you are a potential target to an array of cyber threats, such as hackers, keyloggers, and Trojans that attack through unpatched security holes. A firewall works as a barrier, or a shield, between your PC and cyberspace. Basic firewalls such as the one included in your operating systems, only monitor incoming traffic by default. This may give you a false sense of security. Keep in mind, outgoing traffic, with your credit card information, bank accounts, and social security number is not protected.

With thousands of enterprises using pfSense software, it is fast the world's most trusted open source network security solution. pfSense has all of the features you would find in a commercial firewall solution and more, and it is absolutely free!
